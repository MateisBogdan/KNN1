# KNN1
Machine learning using KNN and K-means algorithms, tabbed-chart generated with results.
The project requires the jfreecharts(http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) to be added in order to run. It was created on version 1.0.19

The project reads the data from each file, one is used for learning and the other for testing.
An accuracy value is generated and recorded.
A different parameter is used for another round of learning and testing(nearest neighbours for KNN and amount of centroids for k-means).
